##  ZAP – EV Charging Station Locator

**ZAP** is a simple and efficient website built to help users locate the nearest electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at their fingertips. Developed during our first hackathon, this project aimed to address the increasing need for accessible charging infrastructure by offering a lightweight and easy-to-use web platform.

###  What It Does

* Helps users find the **closest EV charging station** using integrated maps.
* Offers a **hassle-free experience** with a clean, minimal UI.
* Aims to save time and money by improving charging accessibility.

###  Tech Stack

* **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
* **Bootstrap** for responsive design
  *(Early versions involved experimentation with Python but the final build is front-end focused.)*

###  Key Features

* Map integration for real-time location lookup.
* Simple interface designed for quick access.
* Functional MVP built under tight time constraints.

###  What We Learned

* How to embed geolocation APIs and integrate interactive maps.
* The value of **team collaboration**, quick idea iteration, and time management.
* Applying classroom knowledge in a practical, real-world scenario under pressure.

###  Challenges Faced

* Embedding and configuring map APIs properly.
* Managing limited time during the hackathon.
* Debugging unexpected front-end behavior while keeping the project aligned with our goals.

###  What’s Next

* Adding a **notification system** for nearby chargers.
* Including **charger status**, like crew availability or operational issues.
* Building a **discount and perks network** for EV users.
* Listing **service centers and other amenities** near charging stations.
